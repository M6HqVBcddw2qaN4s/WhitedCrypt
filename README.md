# WhitedCrypt

An encryption algorithm made by me from the ground up. This goes without saying, but I do **NOT** advise using this algorithm for encrypting any important data as the algorithm can't be considered secure enough.
I refuse to take any responsibility if any data you encrypt using this algorithm gets cracked.

Pull requests are welcome.
